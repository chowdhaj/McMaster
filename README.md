# McMaster
This repository contains a collection of courses, mostly Computer Science, that I have taken at McMaster University. Please note that this is not the full set because there are some courses I forgot to document, and other courses' files got lost in the digital sea. Nonetheless, this list is quite apt (i.e. sufficient). If there is any typo/mistake/issue, please bring it to my attention as soon as possible. Thank you.

"None of the authors, contributors, administrators, vandals, or anyone else connected with this repository, in any way whatsoever, can be responsible for your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages. Use at your own discretion."

Furthermore, due to size and performance constraints, GitHub limits how many files, and the size of files. If you encounter an incomplete folder with missing content, and you require its documents, please do not hesitate to reach out. If GitHub did not place severe limitations on size, I would have uploaded everything; no holds barred. The entire repository on my HDD is ~49GB. I had to remove 90% of the material so GitHub would accept it.
