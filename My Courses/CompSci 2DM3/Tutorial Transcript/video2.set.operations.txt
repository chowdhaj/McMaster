In this video, I'm going to introduce Set Operations. Similar to how we can manipulate numbers by adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, etc., we can manipulate sets using their respective operations. These operations are: Union, Intersection, Complement, and Difference. Let's assume we have the following sets (and to keep things simple, let's stick with our original marble bag):

MarbleBag1 = {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow}
MarbleBag2 = {Red, Blue, Green, Purple}

Union
The union of MarbleBag1 and MarbleBag2 is "adding both sets together". We take everything in MarbleBag1, and everything in MarbleBag2, and put them into a new set, - which we will call MarbleBagUnion. Plus, since sets can only contain unique members, we remove the duplicates. For example:

MarbleBag1 U MarbleBag2 = {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow} U {Red, Blue, Green, Purple}
            = {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, Blue, Green, Purple}
            = {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple} 
              (Remove the Duplicates)

MarbleBagUnion = {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple}

Intersection
The intersection of MarbleBag1 and MarbleBag2 is the set of elements in BOTH MarbleBag1 and MarbleBag2. In other words, we take the common members of both sets. For example:

MarbleBag1 [Complement] MarbleBag2 = {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow} [Complement] {Red, Blue, Green, Purple}
                                   = {Red, Blue, Green}

MarbleBagComplement = {Red, Blue, Green}
The common elements between MarbleBag1 and MarbleBag2 are Red, Blue, and Green

Difference
The difference of MarbleBag1 and MarbleBag 2 is the set of elements that are exclusive to each bag. For example:

MarbleBag1 -- MarbleBag2 = {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow} -- {Red, Blue, Green, Purple}
                         = {Yellow, Purple}

MarbleBag1 does not have Purple, and MarbleBag2 does not have Yellow. Thus, the difference between these two sets is: {Yellow, Purple}
MarbleBagDifference = {Yellow, Purple}

Complement
This one is bit harder to explain using Marbles. So let's jump back to natural numbers. Quick recap: The natural numbers are integers from 0 to infinity. This is the set of Natural Numbers. Every number from 0 to Infinity. (This is half right, but let's just assume it is for demonstration purposes). If we had a set of natural numbers containing only even numbers, then the complement of that set would be only odd natural numbers. For example:

setOfEvenNumbersBelow10 = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
The complement of this set would be {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
Complement is every element not in the set.
