- A universal turing machine can simulate any Turing machine

- The universal Turing machine accepts an encoding scheme over {0,1}. 
- The Turing machine that it accepts is represented by a String of {0,1} and its input is also represented with {0,1]}

- Universal Turing machines make Turing machines very powerful



Undecidable Problems

	Diagonalization

		- Georg Cantor should that there does not exist a bijection
		f : N -> PS(N)
		- The proof was done by diagonalization

Halting Problem

	- The halting problem is the problem of deciding whether a given Turing Machine will halt on a given input

	- The halting problem is semidecidable according to proposition 3

	- Any universal Turing machine semidecides the halting problem

	- The halting problem is undecidable according to theorem 3
		- Shown by Church and Turing
		- Proof is done by diagonalization
	
	- Watch Neso Academy for more info.

	- Leibniz's Dream of having a computer solve all problems is not possible due to the Halting problem as shown by Turing and Church.

Reduction

	- If A is reducible to B and B is r.e. then A is r.e.
		- Both A and B can be accepted by a Turing machine
	- If A is reducible to B and B is recursive, then A is recursive
		- There is a total Turing machine for both A, and B

Undecidable Problems

	- There are many undecidable problems in CAS
	- The main techniques for showing undecidable problems are:
		1. Diagonalization
		2. Reduction
