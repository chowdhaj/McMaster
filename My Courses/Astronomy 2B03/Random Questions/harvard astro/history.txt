HISTORY
--------

The old geocentric view of the universe held that the Earth 
was surrounded by a celestial sphere that held the stars and
   a) never moved. 
  $b) rotated from east to west each day.                       
   c) rotated from west to east each day.                       
   d) took one year to rotate around the Earth.                 

Explanations of planetary motion were more difficult in ancient
times than the motions of the Sun and moon because the
  $a) planets reverse their motion sometimes (retrograde motion).
   b) Sun and moon always go in retrograde motion.          
   c) planets are much fainter than the Sun and moon.           
   d) planets move much faster than the Sun and moon. 

Which two fundamental misconceptions made Ptolemy's geocentric model
very complicated and prevented it from adequately describing the
movements of bodies in the solar system.
	I)   The Sun is at the center of the Universe.
	II)  All heavenly bodies move in combinations of perfect circles.
	III) The Earth is at the center of the Universe.
	IV)  The stars never move.
   a) I and IV
   b) II only
   c) III only
  $d) II and III

Epicycles are needed in the geocentric model to explain why
  $a) planets seem to vary in brightness and speed over the year
   b) some planets are brighter than others 
   c) the Sun rises and sets
   d) all planets cannot necessarily be seen on any given night

Why are the phases of Venus at odds with the geocentric epicycle picture?
   a) Venus would not be expected to significantly change size.
   b) Venus would not appear "new" as the Moon does.
  $c) Venus would not appear "full" as the Moon does.

Galileo's discovery of the Moons of Jupiter was shocking because it
showed those who believed the Earth to be at the center of the
Universe that 
    a) a planet could have more than one moon.
    b) Earth was unusual to have only one moon.
    c) gravity could hold a moon in orbit.
    d) Jupiter does not move.
   $e) moons could move around a moving planet.

Galileo's observations of sunspots discredited Aristotle's 
teachings because it showed                              
   $a) change in the heavens without uniform circular motion
    b) planets move on epicycles
    c) the Earth's orbit is elliptical
    d) planets orbit around the Sun
    e) the Sun isn't perfectly spherical

The revolution epitomized by Copernicus that still dominates
scientific thought could be described as having moved our view of
mankind's place in the Universe from 
     a) the edge towards the Big Bang
     b) the center to the edge
    $c) a special place to an average place
     d) an average place to a special place

Newton explained Kepler's laws by
   a) putting Kepler's complicated formulas into words that could be
      easily understood 
   b) giving them a sound religious footing  
  $c) showing mathematically that the planets moved according to a few
      universal principles of motion and gravity 
   d) the "music of the spheres"

In the scientific method, observations (data) are most useful for
    $a) testing predictions made by theories.
     b) making predictions.
     c) proving theories.
     d) generating catalogs.

The best test of a scientific hypothesis is how
    a) well it explains all known observations
    b) well it agrees with known theories
    c) simply it explains all known observations
   $d) well it predicts new observations
    e) easily it is transcribed into mathematical notation
   
Faraday performed crucial experiments, and Maxwell contributed
a complete mathematical theory for
  $a) the wave description of electromagnetic phenomena
   b) the wave/particle duality
   c) wave phenomena in nature
   d) the transformation of electromagnetic charge into radiation
