The distance between the earth and the sun is just right for liquid water to exist. It's not to hot and not to cold

The sun is an ideal low mass star that isn't to dim, but has a long life

Earth's atmosphere moderates the temperature and keeps it habitable

Earth's atmosphere is the right amount

Life was we know it requires liquid water, and earth has an abundance of water

Earth has a good ratio of water and land

Water on earth was delivered from icy objects like comets

250 million years ago was the Permian extinction which removed around 90% of life on earth

65 million years ago was the end of Cretaceous era which caused the extinction of the dinosaurs

The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was around 10km in diameter

Asteroid impacts can cause:
Global firestorm
Dust blocking the sun and disrupting the food chain because no photosynthesis

Asteroids in the asteriod belt are kicked out of orbit by Jupiter's gravity and set on a different course that may collide with earth

An asteroid that is 100m or less poses little threat to earth. Most of the time it burns up in the asteroid. Occurs many times per century

An asteroid that is a few kilometers can cause damage on a continent-size scale. This asteroid occurs once every thousand years

Asteroids that are 10 - 100 kilometers can cause major damage to the whole biosphere. These occur every 100 million years or so

Jupiter absorbs many comets and asteroids and protects Earth

Radiation from a supernova can potentially kill all life on earth. 

If a supernova occurs 30 light years away, it can harm life on earth

Mass extinction period can lead to the rapid proliferation of diversified life 

Liquid water may exist on Europa, as observed by Hubble Space Telescope

Titan has similar conditions to early stages of Earth. It has liquid lakes on its surface comprised of ethane/methane

Titan's atmosphere is rich in organic molecules

Life requires three ingredients:
Liquid water: Facilitates biological reactions
Organic molecules: To create biological processes
Source of energy that life can utilize

Extremophiles can survive in extreme environments

Tardi grades (Water bears) can survive the most extreme environments in space, sea, land, temperature, etc.

The James Webb Telescope will be used to measure spectra for extrasolar planets and search for signs of life
