The early universe was foggy because light would constantly scatter and change directions due to the ionized gas

Big Bang nucleosynthesis only lasted for 30 mins

We cannot see the very beginning of the universe because it was opaque

Lookback time has a fundamental limit

The universe is very bright in the microwave spectrum

Stars are 90% hydrogen and 10% helium because of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

The oldest stars in the universe are 13 billion years old

1 divided by the Hubble constant is an estimation of the age of the universe

Evidence for the Big Bang is: Cosmic Background Radiation, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Hubble Expansion, Homogeneity of universe, and age of stars
