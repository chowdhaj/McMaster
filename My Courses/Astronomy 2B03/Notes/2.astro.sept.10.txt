The asteroid belt lives between mars and jupiter

The biggest object in the asteroid belt is Ceres

Ceres is a dwarf planet

Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt and some of those objects are dwarf planets

A planet must be in orbit around the sun, close to round in shape, and have a unique orbit

A dwarf planet must be in orbit around the sun, close to round in shape, does not have a unique orbit, and cannot be satellite/moon

All dwarf planets are found in the asteroid and kuiper belts

Comets are filled with ice and a potential source of water

AU is astronomical unit

1 AU is the distance between the earth and the sun

1 AU is 150 million Km

AU is only relevant for distances in our solar system

Pluto found because its gravity was affecting Neptune's orbit

The sun makes up 99.8% mass of the entire solar system

Midlife stars only shine for 10 billion years

The sun is about 4.5 billion years

The sun is expected to shine for another 5.5 billion years

As the sun grows older it gets brighter, hotter, and bigger

The sun takes 225-250 million years to orbit the Milky Way

Humans cannot be sent to the nearest stars or galaxies

The nearest star to us is Alpha Centauri

There is no way we can travel at or greater than the speed of light

The expansion of the universe is 70 kilometers per second per mega parsec

The center of our galaxy has a black hole in the middle

Blue stars are hotter than red stars

The parallax effect is used to measure the distance of nearby stars

The parallax effect measures the distance a nearby object has moved relative to faraway ones

Orbit size affects the potency of the parallax effect

Large distances are measured in parsecs or light years

A light year is how far light travels in one year

1 parsec is 3.3 light years
