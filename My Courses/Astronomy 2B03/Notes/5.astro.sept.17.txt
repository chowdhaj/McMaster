Hubble's Law describes the relationship between how fast a galaxy is moving and its distance from us

The speed of a galaxy is measured using the Doppler shift

The distance of a galaxy from us is measured using the Standard Candle method

All the galaxies, except for Andromeda, are moving away from us

Galaxies that are orbiting each other do not move away from each other 

The age of the universe is 13.8 billion years

There are two ways to collect data: Imaging and Spectroscopy

Earth's atmosphere blocks out light from the Electromagnetic spectrum

Radio and visible light are the easiest to do from Earth

The lowest energy light is Radio light

The longer the wave length, the lower the energy

Light can travel through a vacuum

Sound needs a medium to travel
