The moon has more craters on its surface than the earth because it doesnt have geological weathering

The distance between galaxies is a million times bigger than the distances between stars

We live in the Milky Way galaxy

The closest galaxy to us is Andromeda

The Milky Way and Andromeda are on a collision course. This will happen in a couple billion years

Terrestrial planets are like the earth and have solid surfaces you can stand on

Terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars

It would take about 6 months to get to Mars with current technology using the most efficient path

The gas giant planets have no surface to stand on

The largest planet in the solar system is Jupiter

Jupiter has 79 moons; the most of any planets in our solar system

Europa, Jupiter's Moon, is covered in a thick layer of ice and there is liquid water beneath it

There may be simple micorbial life on Europa

The Cassini mission is about learning about Saturn

Titan, Saturn's Moon, may have life on it

Saturn is the only planet with Rings

Saturn's rings are incredibly thin

Saturn's rings are made up of ice, dust, and small rocks

Stars twinkle, planets do not

Uranus and Neptune are big blue balls of gas. They are very far away from the sun

Pluto is not a planet

Pluto is part of the Kuiper Belt

The Kuiper Belt is comprised of a bunch of objects that orbit the sun

There is an Asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter

The smallest star is very very very bigger than the largest planet

The terrestrial planets are very tiny compared to the gas giants

In our solar system we have 4 terrestrial planets and 4 gas giants, and all are in orbit around the sun

Pluto does not have a circular orbit

Pluto has an elliptical orbit

Pluto is a dwarf planet

Solar means sun

The edge of the solar system is the dwarf planets

A planet is a celestial body that is in orbit around the sun, close to round in shape, and has a unique orbit

Large objects are spherical because of gravity 

The definition of planets is only valid for our solar system

The sun is the center of our solar system

The sun is a giant ball of gas burning fuel at an incredible rate that makes it hot. It has a nuclear reactor at its core

Solar storms cause northern lights and can disrupt cell phone service
