Everyone measures the same speed of light

Nothing can move faster than the speed of light

Anything with mass always moves at speeds less than c

Only massless things can remove at the speed of light

Moving clocks run more slowly

Moving frame of references have slower clocks

Time appears to move more slowly in a moving frame

Time dilation occurs at speeds greater than 0.5c

Objects seen in moving reference frames appear shorter along the direction of motion than the same object seen at rest

If the speed of light is constant for all observers, at relativistic speeds, time and distance are distorted

GPS satellite coordinations rely on relativistic corrections to be accurate 

Gold gets its color because of special relativity

E = mc^2 says that energy is equivalent to mass

Everything with mass has energy

Moving mass is bigger than rest mass

Mass is increased by the same factor as time dilation

The gamma factor affects mass, and time

Nothing with mass can go at the speed of light because it will take an infinite amount of energy

Mass noticeably increases at speeds greater than 0.5c

Combining two speeds less than the speed of light always results in a speed that is also less than c

Regardless of the motion of the source, light always travels at c

It would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a physical object up to the speed of light

The fourth dimension is time

In a spacetime diagram a vertical line indicates an object at rest

Horizontal lines are impossible in a spacetime diagram
