LIGO and Virgo detect gravitational waves from black holes and neutron stars which confirms Einstein's theory of General relativity

Each element has a specific number and that tells us the number of protons it has

10 most abundant elements in humans: Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Calcium, Phosphorous, Potassium, Sulfur, Chlorine, Magnesium

3 Minutes after the big bang, all the hydrogen in the universe was created

The big bang created hydrogen, helium, and some parts of lithium

Stars create the rest of the elements

Stars are created in stellar nurseries [i.e. Pillars of Creation at the Eagle Nebula]

Hydrogen is the main material of the stars

All stars are created from one specific cloud that have exactly the same composition for the same material

Clouds of gas can create stars of different masses

The initial mass of a star determines its life

The sun is a low mass star

Betelgeuse is a high mass star

The sun is 150 million kilometers away from us

It takes light 8.5 minutes to reach earth from the sun

Nuclear fusion powers all the stars in the universe

The strong nuclear force keeps the atoms in the nuclei, together

Stars convert hydrogen into helium using nuclear fusion

Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe

4 hydrogens make 1 helium

The temperature inside the sun for nuclear fusion is 10 million degrees

The surface of the sun is 6000 degrees

Iron is the most stable atom, it is the highest binding energy

Iron cannot be split or squeezed together to create energy

Iron cannot be used as a fuel for stars

Energy source of a sun is called a hydrogen fusion pp-chain [pp = proton-proton]

The sun burns 4.3 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second

The sun creates 3.8x10^26 Joules of energy every second

Right now, the sun is 75% hydrogen and 25% helium

Once a star uses up its fuel, the core will be entirely helium

Once its entirely helium, the core will gradually shrink under gravity and grow hotter

At 100 million degrees, the star's core has enough force to create carbon and oxygen

Nuclear fusion counteracts the force of gravity and keeps the star in equilibrium; so it doesn't collapse

Gravity and pressure increase as you approach the center of the star

Lifetime of a star is proportional to (Mass / Luminosity)

A stars mass is related to the amount of fuel available

A stars luminosity is related to the rate at which fuel is used up

Big stars are burning their fuel much faster than smaller stars

Low mass stars live much longer than high mass stars

The sun is 4.5 billion years old

The universe is 13.8 billion years old

The sun will last another 5.5 billion years old

The sun as a red giant will have a diameter of 2 AU

After the sun becomes a red giant, it will lose its mass and become a planetary Nebula

After planetary Nebula it will become a white dwarf

A white dwarf is around 100,000 K

A white dwarf will eventually turn into a black dwarf

Most of the stars in the universe (97%) will end up as white dwarfs

A white dwarf can steal material, mostly hydrogen, from a neighbouring star, become large, and then explode. This creates new elements
