Gravity is equal to 9.81 km/s^2

Gravity slightly deviates on earth depending on where you are and how high above sea level

The speed of light is the same for all observers

Light can behave like a wave and a particle

In 1905 Einstein published his special relativity paper

The speed of light is 300,000,000 m/s and is always the same for all observers

The speed of everything is relative, except for the speed of light

Nothing with mass can move at the speed of light

Nothing can move faster than the speed of light

Anything with mass always moves at speeds less than c

From different reference frames, there can never be agreements on the simultaneity of events

Time dilation: The same event does not take the same amount of time for every different observer

In time dilation, both observers think each other's clocks are running slow
