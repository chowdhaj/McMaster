Light can come in little chunks, like particles, and they're called photons

Shining light on metal frees up a bunch of electrons, proving that light has momentum

The amount of energy that a packet of light has is related to the frequency of the light

The higher the frequency, the higher the energy

If a star is moving away, its frequency of light is smaller

Particles can behave like waves

Quantum tunneling is when a particle doesn't have enough energy to climb a hill, but still appears on the other side

Quantum tunneling happens on the scale of nanometers

Because of quantum tunneling, an electron can be inside the nuclei of an atom

Without quantum tunneling there would be no nuclear fusion in the sun

Quantum tunneling is used in the sun, electronics, and microscopes

The double slit experiment proves that particles can behave like a wave

A particles wave like property depends on how big it is

A heavier a particle gets, the wave like behaviour gets minimized and harder to measure

To measure the position of something, you bounce something off it. But when you bounce light off of particles, their position changes

Heisenburg's uncertainty principle states that you cannot measure position and momentum at the same time

The uncertainty principle only allows you to measure one. If you know one, you don't know the other

A particle does not have both position and momentum since any measurement of one disturbs the other

The uncertainty principle only works on very small scales

Quantum particles can behave like particles or waves

Quantum physics is inherently probabilistic
