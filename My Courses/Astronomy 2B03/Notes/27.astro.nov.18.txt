The early universe was very hot and nuclear fusion was occuring everywhere

The early universe had no atoms, only free electrons and nuclei

When the universe cooled to 3000 degrees, atoms formed

At 350,000 years old, the universe went from being opaque to transparent

Microwave astronomy cannot be done on earth

There is not enough matter in the universe to stop the expansion

The universe will continue to expand indefinitely

The Big Bang happened everywhere at once

Protons and neutrons are not fundamental particles, they are made up of quarks and neutrinos

Light stopped scattering once the universe was 3000 degrees

The first stars and galaxies formed after 500 million years after the Big Bang

The false vacuum state has nothing; no stars, no galaxies, no particles, no forces, no light

The false vacuum state has only energy, no stuff

The expansion of the universe can happen at a rate faster than the speed of light

There is no restriction on the speed with which the spacetime grid expands

The energy in the false vacuum is used to make all material through E = mc^2

The observable universe is the region of space from which light has had time to reach us

Our visible universe can be much smaller than the entire universe

The model of inflation explains why the universe is flat

The geometry of the observable universe is flat
