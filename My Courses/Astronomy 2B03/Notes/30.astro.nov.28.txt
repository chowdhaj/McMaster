Dark matter is stuff that does not interact with light and we detect it through gravitational measurements like the orbits of stars

Dark Matter accounts for 90% of the mass of galaxies and clusters

Dark Matter extends well beyond the visible part of galaxies

Dark matter does not interact with light at any wavelength

Normal matter is baryonic matter; made up of baryons

Baryons are things made up of protons and neutrons, and interacts with light

Dark matter is any type of mass that does not emit light and is detectable through its gravity

Dark energy is pure energy and does not produce gravity

Dark energy is harder to detect than dark matter

The supernova distance is always more than Hubble's law distance, and the further away a galaxy is the bigger the discrepancy

In the early universe, gravity was winning and causing the expansion to slow down

Currently, dark energy is causing the universe to expand and is beating the gravitational force

As the universe expands, there is more space, and more space = more dark energy

In the future, due to expansion, we won't be able to see other galaxies

Roughly 70% of the universe is roughly dark energy

Evidence for Dark Energy: Supernovae to measure expansion rate, details in CBR map, gravitational lensing

A cosmological constant is a certain amount of energy per unit volume of space

As the universe expands, there is more volume, thus, more energy

Dark energy does not dilute; more space = more energy

Dark energy is spread uniformly throughout space and keeps an approximate density
