Cosmology is the study of the universe on big scales

The electromagnetic spectrum: Radio < Micro < Infrared < Ultraviolet < X-Rays < Gamma

The entire electromagnetic spectrum is light

Long wavelength is low energy and low frequency

Short wavelength is high energy and high frequency

Frequency is how many waves are recieved per second

Everything other than optical images are false color images. The energies are mapped to visible light

Infrared light is heat

You can combine data of different wavelengths to make a color image and you can use any wavelength and map it into colors we can see

Blackholes do not suck

The atmosphere blurs images

It is always better to take pictures in space because the resolution is higher and nothing gets blurred out

Bigger telescopes are better because they let in more light

Mass is a measure of the inertia of an object

The greater the mass, the harder it is to accelerate it

Speed is the distance travelled in a second

The speed of light is 300,000,000 m/s
