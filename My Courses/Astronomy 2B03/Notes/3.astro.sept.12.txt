Satellite missions are destroyed to avoid introducing germs to planets that may have life

We cannot take a 3rd person picture of the Milky Way

Interstellar medium is thin and gaseous material

Stars are born from Interstellar medium that collapses under gravity

Stars are building blocks of galaxies

Galaxies are building blocks of the universe

A parsec is about 3 light years

Distances within galaxies are measured in light years and parsecs

Distances to other galaxies are measured in mega parsecs

Galaxies have a 100 billion stars on average

An average galaxy is 80,000 light years across

Spiral galaxies are formed when there's a spin on the material that collapses

Elliptical galaxies are formed when two spiral galaxies collide

The solar system is 25,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way

It takes the solar system about 220 million years to orbit the center of the Milky Way

Spiral galaxies are flat and rotating and have a bulge in the middle

Elliptical galaxies are ellipsoids and have a 3D shape

Star formation causes things like galaxies to appear blue

Elliptical galaxies are not blue because most of its stars are red ones

Blue stars die quicker than red stars

Spiral galaxies are flat, rotating disk of stars, gas and dust

Spiral galaxies have arms and have lots of new stars in the arms

Elliptical galaxies are 3D, dont have arms, have no rotation, not forming new stars

Stars in elliptical galaxies have a random orbit

The Milky way galaxy has a bulge and a center and we live far from the center

The Milky way galaxy and Andromeda galaxy will collide in a billion years

The collision between Milky Way and Andromeda wont affect the solar system's stability

Galaxies can live in group or clusters

A galaxy cluster has up to thousands of galaxies in it

The biggest galaxies are elliptical and live at the center of clusters

Star clusters are collection of many stars and are found within galaxies

LookBack Time is what an object looked many years ago. Since light takes time to travel, we are always seeing an old iteration of the object

The LookBack time for the sun is 8 minutes

Gravity also travels at the speed of light
