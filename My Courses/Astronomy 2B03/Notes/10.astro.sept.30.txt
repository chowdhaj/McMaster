Combining two speeds less than the speed of light always results in a speed that is also less than c

Regardless of the motion of the source, light always travels at c

It would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object to the speed of light

All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light

Energy is equivalent to mass

Mass is another form of energy

In a spacetime diagram, the x-axis is distance

In a spacetime diagram, the y-axis is ct

You can't go faster than speed of light b/c if you could you'd be able to send yourself messages in the past

In spacetime diagrams there are areas you can influence b/c they will happen in the future

In spacetime diagrams there are areas you cannot influence b/c you cannot travel faster than light
