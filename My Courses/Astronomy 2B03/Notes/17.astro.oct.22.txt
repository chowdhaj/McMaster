Low mass stars like the sun end their lives as a red giant, planetary nebula, and white dwarf

High mass stars are around 8x heavier than the sun

High mass stars only live for millions of years as compared to low mass stars which live for billions of years

For stars more massive than 1.5 solar masses, the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen [CNO] Cycle burns hydrogen more efficiently than the proton-proton [pp] chain

The CNO cycle has the same net effect as the pp-chain; both convert 4 protons to 1 helium

The CNO cycle: Carbon-12 --> Nitrogen-13 --> Carbon-13 --> Nitrogen-14 --> Oxygen-15 --> Nitrogen 15 --> Helium

Centre of high mass stars has hydrogen burning via CNO, followed by helium burning
Once the helium is exhausted, the core collapses, and starts burning carbon to neon and magnesium
This process is repeated three more times for neon, oxygen, and silicon, until iron is reached

In a high mass star, the star is burning (from outer to inner structure):
	H  --> He
	He --> C, O
	C  --> Ne, Mg
	Ne --> O, Mg
	O  --> Si, S
	Si --> Fe, Ni

Iron cannot be used as a fuel or source of energy

Supernovas occur when the iron core collapses on itself and reaches speeds of 70,000 km/s
The collapsing core bounces back outwards (Strong nuclear force becomes repulsive)
The star explodes in a supernova

Supernova explosions can outshine an entire galaxy

The blast of supernova may compress nearby clouds of gas and trigger the formation of new stars

If the mass of the collapsing supernova is less than 3 solar masses, neutrons are squeezed tightly together in the core

The core of neutron stars is made of neutrons

Neutron stars do not burn material

Neutron stars are in a state of cooling down, they start off at 600,000 K

Neutron stars are the most dense objects in the universe

Neutron stars were first discovered by Joceyln Bell

When two neutron stars merge, they can create elements heavier than iron, gold, silver, etc.

Creation of low mass stars:
Stellar cloud with protostars --> Small star --> Red giant --> Planetary Nebula --> White dwarf

Creation of high mass stars:
Stellar cloud with protostars --> Large star --> Red Supergiant --> Supernova
--> Neutron star IFF core is less than 3 solar masses
--> Black hole IFF core is greater than 3 solar masses

Black holes are objects whose gravity is so intense that light cannot escape

Schwarzschild radius: The larger the mass of the object, the larger the critical radius

Event Horizon: The surface of a black hole
