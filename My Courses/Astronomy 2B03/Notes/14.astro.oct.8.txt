Gravity looks the same as acceleration in an accelerating rocketship

Light beams are affected by gravity

Light bends in a gravitational space

Light leaving a gravitational space is red-shifted - the frequency is lowered

Gravity is so strong in a black hole that light does not escape

Light loses energy when climbing out of a gravitational field

Time advances more slowly for observers close to a gravitational source

Gravity is the manifestation of the distortion of space

Light does not change direction but follows curvature of space

Gravitational lensing is light following cured paths
