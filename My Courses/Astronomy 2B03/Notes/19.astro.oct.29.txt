The Transit method is monitors stars and looks for a dip in brightness to detect a planet overlapping a star 

The Transit method tells us the period and the relative size of the planet

The Doppler method looks for the red/blue shift of a star

The Doppler method tells us the mass and the period

Density of a planet tells us it is like Earth and made of terrestrial rocks, or is a gas giant like Jupiter 

The atmosphere is what caused life to be able to form on earth

Atmosphere of planets can be studied using the Transit method. If the light goes through the atmosphere, information can be extracted from the data

Direct Imaging is good for planets that are far away from the star

Infrared is the easiest band for Direct Imaging

Habitable zone is the best place around a star to look for planets containing signs of life. It is merely a guess

Most of the exoplanets found in habitable zones are between the size of Earth and Neptune

Transit method can estimate the size of a planet

Mass of a planet is obtained using the height of the velocity shift in the Doppler method

Both Transit and Doppler method are needed for Density

NOTE: The Kepler Method is another way of saying Transit Method

Orbital period can be obtained from Transit and Doppler method

Criticism of the habitable zone: 
Life elsewhere can be different than life on earth
Other circumstances attribute to a planet's habitability
Planet migration: A planet could have been habitable in the past, but then due to migration is not anymore

Methods for finding exoplanets: Transit method, Doppler method, and Direct Imaging

Liquid water is necessary for all life on earth

Earth is just the right distance from the sun; not to hot, and not to cold

The habitable zone shifts as a star evolves with time and gets more luminous and hotter

Extremophiles can exist in super high temperatures, supercool temperatures, super acidic solutions, and in super dry places

It took Earth about 4 billion years for a diverse array of multicelled living things to develop

High mass stars have a big habitable zone but die quickly

Low mass stars live long but have a small habitable zone

Atmosphere is critical for sustaining life because it regulates the temperature

To much atmosphere is like venus and becomes super hot

To little atmosphere is like mars and has huge flucuations in temperatures throughout the day
