In a spacetime diagram, everything below the origin and within the light cone can influence us

In a spacetime diagram, everything above the origin and within the light cone is something you can influence 

If we wait long enough, we will see an event not within our light cones

Speed = Frequency X Wavelength

Frequency is how many times does it repeat every second

Wavelength is the horizontal distance between the top of the wave

Bigger wavelength results in smaller frequency

Higher frequency results in smaller wavelength

All light in the EMS behaves the same

Energy is directly related to frequency

EMS from high energy to low energy: Gamma > X > UV > visible > infrared > radio

Since the speed of light is constant, frequency and wavelength can change based on motion of the source/observer

A black body is something that its color is determined by its color and nothing else

Stars are like black bodies

Light comes in little packets called Quanta

Light waves carry energy only in packets

High frequency waves can only carry away energy in huge packets

Temperature is average energy that packets carry

Higher temperature means higher average energy

Momentum = Mass X Speed

Light behaves as a wave and as a particle

The energy of a photon depends on its frequency

Energy = Planck's Constant X Frequency

Frequency and energy move in the same direction

A red shift means that the frequency is going down and so is energy

Red shifted stars are emitting light that is losing energy
