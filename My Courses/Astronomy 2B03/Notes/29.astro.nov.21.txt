Most of the matter in the universe is invisible

Evidence for Dark matter: Motions of galaxies in clusters, spiral galaxy rotation curves, and gravitational lensing

Due to gravitational lensing, light is bent and deflected as it travels through the universe and encounters the curvature of space time 

Gravitational lensing depends on mass; more mass = more curving

Most of the mass in the universe is invisible to us

90% of the mass in galaxies, clusters, etc. is in dark matter

Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOS) is not valid evidence for Dark Matter

MACHOS breaks the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory

All light/radiation is bent the same way

Neutrinos do not interact with light/photons

Our universe is hierarchical; overtime bigger structures form out of smaller structures

Dark Matter is NOT made up of neutrinos

Neutrinos come from the Sun

Dark Matter must exist in the form of particles; WIMPS

WIMPS = Weakly Interacting Massive Particle
