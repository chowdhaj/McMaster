Light cannot escape beyond the black hole's event horizon

Black holes stealing material from its neighbours, going supernova, creates a bright X ray gas

A stellar mass black hole is when a star blows up, is a supernova, and leaves behind a black hole

Super massive black holes live at the center of galaxies

The super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way weighs 1,000,000 solar masses

Super massive black holes are made from accretion disks and/or mergers

Stars are black bodies, if you see their color, you know their temperature

Stars spend most their time burning hydrogen and helium, and are on the main sequence

The CNO cycle makes hotter brighter stars that are in the blue sequence

The PP chain makes lower mass stars that are in the red sequence

Most stars in our galaxy are low mass stars

HR diagram sorts stars by color and luminosity

With time, the main sequence gets shorter and shorter

Length of the main sequence measures how old the stellar cluster is

Turn-off point indicates that a star cluster is old

Cosmology is observational science

The upper left of an HR diagram has high mass stars
