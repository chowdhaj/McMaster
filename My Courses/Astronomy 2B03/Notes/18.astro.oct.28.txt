Exoplanets are planets that are outside the solar system

Small exoplanets are defined identical to small planets in the solar system

The difference between stars and planets is nuclear fusion in the core

Substellar objects that are not big enough to be stars but do have fusion are called Brown Dwarfs

Extra-solar planets need to be in orbit around a star and cannot have a nuclear burning core like stars

The Transit method is used to detect exoplanets 

The transit method is similar to an eclipse, where you wait for the planet to cover the sun and then you measure the brightness to see a dip

The Doppler method or velocity method was first used to detect exoplanets

The Doppler method uses the spectrum of stars to measure its speed or motion towards or away from us. This will change cyclically as its planet orbits around it. Sometimes the light is blue shifted, and sometimes it is red shifted

With the Doppler method:
A bigger orbit implies a slower cycle
A massive planet creates a larger change in velocity
Combine these two to get mass and orbit size of planet

Transit method does not give any information about mass, only size in relation to star

It's harder to detect small earth like planets due to their small effect on the star

The vast majority of planets are found either with the Transit method or Doppler method
 
Planets with low mass with big orbits are not detectable

Kepler data gives us the period and size of the planet

Looking for planets around low mass stars is easier

Direct imaging uses clever light blocking techniques and telecopes to image exoplanets that would not normally be possible
