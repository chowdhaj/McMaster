Gravity is one of the four basic forces of nature

Gravity holds the moon in orbit around the earth, and the earth in orbit around the sun, and the sun in orbit around the centre of the Milky way

Everything that has mass has a gravitational force

There is a balance between the motion of celestial objects and the force of gravity acting on it

The more mass of an object, the stronger the gravitational force

Gravity also attracts light and other massless energetic particles

The strong force is what holds protons and neutrons in the nuclei

The electromagnetic force holds atoms together

The strong force is a 100 times stronger than electromagnetism

The weak force is what causes nuclear decay

The gravitational force is the attraction of one mass on another

Gravity is not a strong force; it's really really really weak

The gravitational force of two objects is: F = G ((M1 x M2) / r^2)

The gravitational force depends on the mass of the two objects and the distance between them, squared

The 'G' constant is very small

The atmosphere is denser at sea level than above is because of gravity

If mass increases, gravitational force increases

If distance increases, gravitational force decreases

Mass is constant no matter where it is

Weight is affected by gravity

Gravity moves at the speed of light
