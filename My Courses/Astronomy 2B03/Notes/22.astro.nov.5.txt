The Fermi Paradox suggests that intelligent life should be common

The Solar System formed from a Solar Nebula; a big ball of gas and dust

Solar Nebula contracts into a rotating disk and a star forms in the centre

Planets are formed when small particles collide with other particles and make bigger bodies

The Solar System started 4.5 billion years ago with a big ball of material that collapsed into a disc, and that disc is where the star and our son and all the planets formed

Water arrived to Earth on comets

Hailey's comet has a period of 74 years

A comet's tail is formed by the Sun heating it up and causing it to streak

A comet has two tails; one is charged and the other is not charged

Comets form in the outer portion of the disk, the same place where the gas giants form

Most comets live in the Oort cloud

The Oort cloud has a radius of approximately 50,000 AU

The distance between the Sun and Pluto is 40 AU

A comet sitting in the Oort cloud gets disturbed by some gravitational force and begins to head for our Solar System

Comets get slinged across by the gravitational force from Big planets like Jupiter

Kuiper Belt objects are found around the orbit of Neptune

Kuiper Belt objects and Comets are typically icy

The Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud are relatively pristine remnants of the nebula from which the entire solar system was formed

Asteroids are predominantly rocky and Comets are mostly ice

When a meteor burns up in Earth's atmosphere, it becomes a meteorite

Meteor showers happen Earth's orbit passes through a bunch of space debris left over from a Comet

The Oort Cloud is bound to the sun and stable

Low mass stars turn into white dwarfs at the end of their cycle

High mass stars blow up as a supernova and leave behind a neutron star or a black hole

Black holes causes spaghettification and stretches you out

The Event Horizon is the point (radius) at a black hole at where even light cannot escape

Escape velocity is the initial speed at which an object needs to be at to escape gravity

Nothing can escape a black hole because nothing can be faster than the speed of light

Anything that falls into a black hole or merges with a black hole becomes a part of the black hole
