Gravitational Lensing: Light is affected by gravity

Distant stars can be seen during a solar eclipse

Clocks in strong gravitational field tick more slowly

In order to escape gravitational pull, light gives up energy

Light is red-shifted by gravity

Light does not bend, it follows the curvature of space

Gravitational waves produce ripples in spacetime

Merging black holes give off gravitational waves

General relativity is for stars, galaxies, black holes and the whole universe

Quantum mechanics is for the smallest structures; electrons, nuclei, quarks

Gravity and quantum mechanics are incompatible at small distances

Spacetime tells matter how to move
