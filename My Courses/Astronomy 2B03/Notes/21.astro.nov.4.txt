Europa is the most promising place to search for life in our Solar System

Currently, we have found more than 4000 extrasolar planets

Bio-signatures are looking for chemical signatures in the atmosphere of a planet we think are associated with life

Detecting planets that are small and faint compared to big bright stars requires very good instruments and very long exposures

James Webb Telescope plans to launch in 2021

James Webb Telescope will be used to measure spectra for extra solar planets and search for 'biosignatures'

SETI searches for repeating radio signals that have to come from life and technology, not nature

Nature does not make lasers, intelligent life does; this is a sign of life

Frank Drake is the founder of the SETI institute and created the Drake equation

In the Drake equation:

	- N is the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible
	- R_* is the average rate of star formation in our galaxy
	- f_p is the fraction of those stars that have planets
	- n_e is the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets
	- f_l is the fraction of n_e that actually goes on to develop life at some point
	- f_i is the fraction of f_l that actually goes on to develop intelligent life
	- f_c is the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space
	- L is the length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space

The revised Drake equation was proposed by Sara Seager; it focuses on simple life

Stars that are not stable and change in pressure and temperature are not good targets for signs of life

The Arecibo message was sent in 1974

The Arecibo message was designed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan

Only civilizations within 100 light years of Earth can detect our presence
