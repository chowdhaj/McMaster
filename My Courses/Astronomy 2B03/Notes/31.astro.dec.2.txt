In the beginning, Einstein thought that the universe was static

Dark energy has some constant density

Every space has some energy in it, and more space = more energy

Universe is expanding because of Dark Energy

In the future, other galaxies in the night sky will no longer be visible

The observable universe is defined as how far we can look back 

There are 6 quarks

Quarks make up protons and neutrons

Neutrinos are released in huge amounts in nuclear reactions

Gravity is not part of the fundamental theory of particle physics

Baryons are particles made up of protons and neutrons; therefore made up of quarks

Regular matter is Baryonic

Leptons are made up of charged and neutrinos

Four fources in order: Strong, EM, Weak, Gravity

A grand unified theory tries to explain three of the forces in terms of a single consistent set of physical laws

A theory of everything would explain all four forces

A theory of everything suggests that all four physical fources were equivlent in the early early universe

In the early universe, the forces were the same, and over time they split off into different forces

For every particle, there is an anti-particle

Particles and antiparticles have opposite electric charge

Anti-matter: Same mass but opposite charge

Anti-matter is used in medicine, in PET scans

In the early universe, there was 1 extra matter particle for every 10 billion anti-matter particles

When anti-matter and matter collide, it creates light/photons

Baryogenisis is the birth of baryons

Universe started with a big bang and was very hot and dense initially, causing nuclear fusion to be everywhere [BBNS]

Once the universe cooled down to 3K, the first atoms were created and caused CBR
