A normal star's gravity is balanced by pressure from nuclear fusion

A white dwarf's gravity is balanced from not being able to pack carbon and oxygen atoms any tighter

A neutron star's gravity is balanced by pressure from not being able to pack neutrons together any tighter

A black hole's gravity is not balanced, causing total collapse

The black hole's event horizon is the boundary at which nothing, not even light, can escape

If something passes a black hole's event horizon, it is never ever coming back

Every object has a critical size below which it becomes a black hole

Schwarzschild Radius: The larger the mass of the object, the larger the critical radius

The Schwarzschild Radius defines the event horizon, it is where the escape velocity equals the speed of light

The bigger a black hole is, the bigger its event horizon is and Schwarzschild radius

Higher escape velocity = More spacetime curvature

The centre of a black hole has an infinite spacetime curvature

Gravity is the bending of spacetime by mass of objects

Spaghettification happens for small black holes, not large black holes

Clocks do not tick at the event horizon of black holes

Light is red shifted to 0 energy at the event horizon of black holes

A good place to look for black holes is binary systems; an object that orbits a black hole

Black holes are found by observing the materials next to them

Stars are black bodies and light comes out at visible wavelengths

When a star orbits something ambiguous, it is orbiting a black hole

Supermassive black holes are at least 100,000 times the mass of the sun and go up to 1,000,000,000 times the mass of the sun

There is a black hole at the center of every big galaxy

A wormhole is when you have two black holes back to back

A black hole is an object so dense that light cannot escape and the surface is where the escape velocity equals the speed of light

Virgo is the nearby galaxy cluster to the Milky Way

If you combine telescopes all over earth, the largest effective size of a telescope is the radius of the earth
