Hubble discovered in 1929 that the universe is expanding

The whole sky is filled with cold, low-energy radio waves in the microwave region of the spectrum

Cosmic Background Radiation [CBR] fills all of space and belongs to the universe as a whole

As the universe expands, the wavelength of light is stretched by the expansion. This is the Cosmological red shift

The CBR gets colder and more dilute as the universe expands

The CBR temperature is now 2.7 degrees above absolute zero

The early universe was filled with higher energy and hotter photons

The early universe did not have galaxies, just hot dense soup of material everywhere

The universe grows hierarchically: Sub-atomic particles --> Atoms --> Stars --> Galaxies --> Clusters of galaxies

As the universe expands, any light in it cools

The early universe was so hot that nuclear fusion occured everywhere

There is no explosion in the Big Bang model

The simplest hydrogen atom is just a proton

Big Bang nucleosynthesis lasted a few minutes and created helium and a little bit of Lithium

75% of the mass in the universe is hydrogen

Most of the universes' helium was created during big bang nucleosynthesis

Ionized gas is a mixture of free electrons and bare atomic nuclei

Light interacts strongly with free electrons

The universe went from being ionized to neutral when it was 3000 degrees OR 380,000 years old
