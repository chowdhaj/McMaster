The inflation theory is more speculative than everything else

The universe is 13.8 billion years old

The whole universe can be much larger than the observable universe

The universe can be bigger than 13.8 billion light years across because it initially grew faster than light

Inflation is the period of rapid growth

Inflation started with a bubble in the universe that was in a false vacuum state and then expanded

Inflation solves the flatness problem

WMAP shows that the universe is very flat

CBR fluctuations agree with expectations from inflation

CBR fluctuations lead to structure formation and all matter

Inflation describes the rapid expansion of the universe in very early times

Inflation helps answer the question, "Why is the universe so flat?"

Inflation theory suggests that there could be many universes

Dark energy causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate

All galaxies are moving away from us, and the ones that are further away, are moving away faster

Fritz Zwicky was the first person to theorize Dark Matter

More mass = Higher escape velocity

Galaxies with more mass rotate faster

Rotating galaxies are evidence of Dark Matter

Gravitational lensing can measure dark matter

Dark matter does not interacting with light
