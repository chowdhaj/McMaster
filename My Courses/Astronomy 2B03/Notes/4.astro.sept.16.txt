After Milky Way merges with Andromeda, it will turn into a yellow elliptical galaxy

When Milky Way collides with Andromeda, the solar system will end up in the center

1 light year is 9.46x10^12

The merger of two galaxies uses up all the gas, thus no new stars are formed

Galaxies are getting farther apart from each other as time goes on

The universe is expanding

The parallax effect does not work beyond the Milky way

The Standard Candle method measures the brightness of galaxies over time and computes its distance based on how the brightness changes

The standard candle method relies on the explosion of supernovas

Variable stars are used to measure distance to nearby galaxies

The Doppler effect is used to determine if a galaxy is moving away or toward you

The Doppler effect relies on measuring spectrum lines to see if the lines are shifted to the left or right

A shift to the left is red shifted

A shift to the right is blue shifted

Objects coming toward you are blue shifted

Objects moving away from you are red shifted

The vast majority of gas in space is hydrogen and helium

Hubble's Law describes the relation between the motion of a galaxy and its distance from us

Speed is proportional to distance: V = Hd

H is Hubble's constant

The further a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away
