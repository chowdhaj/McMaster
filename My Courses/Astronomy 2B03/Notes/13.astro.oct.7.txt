Hesienberg uncertainty principle says you cannot know both location or the position and speed or momentum of something at the same time

Uncertainty principle only works on very small scales like electrons

Tiny fluctuations in mass can lead to big changes in energy

Above a certain particle size, the De Broglie waves are so insignificant

Anti-matter is real but does not last very long because it reacts with matter and turns into energy

Energy can be turned into a particle and an anti-particle for a short period of time

There is more matter than anti-matter

Empty space is not empty because of the uncertainty principle

Quantum in everyday life: Lasers, transistors, accuracy of clocks, and cryptography

Quantum mechanics says that before you do the experiment, both answers are true. Doing the experiment is what collapses all possibilities down to one that you measure

Niehls Bohr proposed that electrons had specific orbits and each orbit had specific energies

Only a photon with exactly the right energy/frequency can cause an electron to jump levels

Light has both wave and particle properties

Light has no mass but has energy and momentum

Principle of equivlence: No experiment performed in one place can distinguish a gravitational field from an accelerated reference frame
