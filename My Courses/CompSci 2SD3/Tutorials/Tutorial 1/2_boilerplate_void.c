int main(void) {

/*
 * The return type is set to 'int', and the parameter(s) is/are set
 * to 'void'. Meaning, the `main()` function does not take any input
 * (read: parameters), and once it finishes executing it returns an
 * 'int'. Notice that the `main()` function does not actually return
 * anything in this case. This is because it is missing the following:
 *
 *      return 0;
 *
 * Recall that the `main()` function is quite versatile. If the
 * return type is set to 'void' or a 'return' statement is missing,
 * then the compiler (gcc) will throw a warning, but not an error.
 * Errors prevent compilation.
