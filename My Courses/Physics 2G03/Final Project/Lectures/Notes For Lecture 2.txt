Physics 2G03 - Project Lecture 02

- Your project should ultimately be unique and different from someone else's project
    - The best way to do this is to propose a more complex extension or case
        - i.e. Introduce a third or fourth variable into a predator/prey model

- The project should not be a numerical experiment
    - Plotting a fixed answer is not a model

- Exploring thouands of probabilities is often called the Monte Carlo approach
    - i.e. Calculating many different trajectories and finding the interesting ones

- Classes Of Problems
    - Solving system of ODEs
    - Monte Carlo
    - Optimization
    - AI, Neural Nets
    - Solving PDEs
    - Particles

- Steps
    - In the beginning, just get a working program
        - It doesn't matter how simple it is
    - Test the model and show it works
        - Compare produced results with known answers
    - Describe a science goal
        - What were you trying to do?
            - Answering this question will help you get a good grade
    - Write Up
        - A full report containing all information outlined in the documents
            - Show plots and things you tried

- A basic version of the program will result in a reasonable grade
- An outstanding version of the program will be an amazing grade

- Use Runge-Kutta instead of Euler and Predictor Corrector
- Leapfrog method is good for dynamical methods
    - Used in games to calculate projectile motion and other movements
        - Called Verlet in game engines

- Avoid using SI units
    - Use values close to one, especially for testing
