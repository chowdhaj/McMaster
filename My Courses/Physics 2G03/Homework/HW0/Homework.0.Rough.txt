Physics 2G03 - Homework 0

(1) Where Am I?

The `pwd` command outputs:
/1/home/chowdhaj

This is the current directory I am in.
Also, it tells me the full path of the
current directory, starting from the 
home directory.

(2) What Does A Command Do Again?

N/A

(3) Creating A Directory

N/A

(4) What Do I Have?

The `ls` command outputs:
hw0/

(5) Moving Around

After changing directory to 'hw0' and
confirming with `pwd`, the command outputs:
/1/home/chowdhaj/HOMEWORK/hw0

(6) Files VS. Directories

After creating the file 'example.txt', the
command `ls` outputs:
example.txt  HW0.txt

(7) Home Again

After running the command `ls HOMEWORK/hw0`,
the output is:
example.txt  HW0.txt

(8) Copying

The output of the `pwd` and `ls` command is:
/1/home/chowdhaj/HOMEWORK/hw0/bottom
&
example.txt

(9) Copying 2

The output of the `ls` command is:
example.txt

(10) A Useful Command Line Tip

After pressing TAB on the command `ls m`, the
shell completes the name and types out 'middle'
for me. The end result is:
[chowdhaj@phys-ugrad hw0]$ ls middle/

(11) Moving

After moving the 'middle' directory into 'top',
the commands `ls` and `pwd` output the following:
middle/
&
/1/home/chowdhaj/HOMEWORK/hw0/top

After changing into the 'bottom' directory, the
commands `ls` and `pwd` output the following:
example.txt
&
/1/home/chowdhaj/HOMEWORK/hw0/top/bottom

(12) Removing

After deleting 'example.txt' with the `rm`
command, the command `ls` outputs:
bottom/  HW0.txt  top/

After deleting the 'bottom' directory and
all of its contents, the command `ls` outputs:
middle/

(13) A Few Command Line Tips For Navigating

The output of `ls` and `pwd` from the 'side'
directory is:
sideexample.txt
&
/1/home/chowdhaj/HOMEWORK/hw0/top/side

(14) Editing Files

After saving the text file with gedit, the
`ls` command outputs:
example.txt  testexample.txt

(15) Inspecting Text Files From The Command Line

The command `more` outputs:
[chowdhaj@phys-ugrad bottom]$ more testexample.txt 
write a nice message

(16) Renaming Files

The command `more` on the empty text file
'example.txt' outputs nothing. This is because
the text file is empty.

The command `ls` outputs the following:
emptyexample.txt  testexample.txt

(17) Inspecting Text Files From The Command Line

The `ls -l` command on the 'bottom' directory
outputs the following:
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 chowdhaj chowdhaj  0 Sep 28 18:04 emptyexample.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 chowdhaj chowdhaj 21 Sep 28 18:07 testexample.txt

The difference between both text files are: size, name, and time created.
The size is different because one is empty the other is not.
The names are different because two files cannot have the same name.
The time created is different because both were created asynchronously.
