    P1 = (x1, y1)
    P2 = (x2, y2)

    y = mx + c

    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    c = y - mx

    Yes, there is a faster way to find the right index, if and only if the x_i values are uniformly spaced and the spacing between them is known. In this case, the best solution would be to use the slope; the 'm' from 'y = mx + b'.

    Alternatively, you could also subtract 'x' from the first 'x_i' value and then divide the result by the spacing to get the right index. If the number is a float, then round up or down accordingly.

    Output from "testinterp.cpp" is:

        Y-Intercept Is: 15.0625
        Y-Intercept Is: 15.0625
        Y-Intercept Is: 20.6275
        Y-Intercept Is: 6.7375
