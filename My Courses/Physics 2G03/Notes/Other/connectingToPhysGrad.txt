    - ls -a /home/2G03
        - The option is `-a` and the argument is `/home/2G03`

- You can find more information about commands with manual pages, also referred to as `man` pages. For example: man ls

        - Everything starting with any one character and ending in G03
    - ls HW[123]
        - Anything matching HW1, HW2, and HW3
    - ls [a-z]*

- More commands:
    - ls :: Lists files
    - mv :: Move or rename files

    - head    :: Look at top 10 lines
        - head fileName
    - tail -n :: Look at last n number of lines
        - tail -5 fileName

- The best way to learn is to practice!
- Learn by doing, trying, and repeating!
