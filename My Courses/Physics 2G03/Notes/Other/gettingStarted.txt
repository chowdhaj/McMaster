- A terminal allows you to connect to the server
    - It is a window that looks like an editor
    - Interprets commands as you type them
- X-server allows you to pop up new windows

- SSH allows you to connect to a new computer and run commands
    - If you're on a windows machine, install MobaxTerm
    - If you're on a mac, install XQuartz

- Connect to the server with the following command:
ssh -XY macid@phys-ugrad@mcmaster.ca
- The temporary password is: 2g03

- Programs that can pop-up new windows under unix are often prefaced with an 'x'. For example:
    - xterm &
    - xeyes &
    - gedit fileName &
    - xemacs fileName &

- Use SCP and STFP to copy files between your machine and the server. For example:
scp localFile macid@phys-ugrad@mcmaster.ca: remoteFile
- Transferring files from unix to windows can cause issues because of the different text file formats
