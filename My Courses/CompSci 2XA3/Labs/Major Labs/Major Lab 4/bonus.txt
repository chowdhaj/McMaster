Consider the .bsb section 
  bytes resb 5
  N resd 1

  This is a picture of the memory:

  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ | | | ]
  <---bytes ----><-- N -->

The "variable" N controls the number of bytes coppied 
to the array 'bytes' and it goes from 0 to 5, so allowing 
to copy 6 bytes, not 5 as claimed.
The sixth byte will be actually coppied to the
leftmost byte of N thus changing the contents
of N, i.e. changing the value of N.
If 12345678901234567890 is entered, the leftmost
byte of N is overriden in such a way that the value
of N gives 58.

How to fix it: two ways, either (a) or (b)

(a) fix the loop to loop only 5 times and not 6 time by changing
        cmp dword [N],5      ; we can accommodate at most 5 integers in bytes
        jbe L1
to
        cmp dword [N],5      ; we can accommodate at most 5 integers in bytes
        jb L1

(b) change the storage for 'bytes' so the copying does not override
    the leftmost byte of N, from

section .bss
bytes resb 5
N resd 1

    to 

section .bss
bytes resb 6
N resd 1
