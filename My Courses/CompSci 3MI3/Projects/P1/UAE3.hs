Question:
Letâ€™s add a new value, wrong, which will be the result of evaluating
nonsense terms, like the one above. The following is an incomplete
set of the rules needed to implement wrong. In the following, V will
be the set of values, as defined in the grammar above, and NV will be
the set of numeric values, as defined above.
-}

-- This is the data type for Value; it can be either Trues or Falses
-- The values mimic (constant) true and (constant) false (in Haskell)
-- A new value, "Wrong" is added to deal with wrongness
data Values = Trues | Falses | Wrong
    deriving (Show, Eq)

-- This is the data type for NumericValue, as per UAE
-- The values are Zero and the successor of a numeric value
data NumericValue = Zero | SuccNV NumericValue
    deriving (Show, Eq)

-- This is the data type for Then
data Thens = Then
    deriving (Show, Eq)

-- This is the data type for Else
data Elses = Else
    deriving (Show, Eq)

-- This is the new data type for Term; it removes the value terms
-- from the old data type Term

{-
The `eval` function and the test cases are the same from `UAE1.hs`;
nothing has been changed. With the addition of the Wrong Value,
something like `testCase3` should evalulate to Wrong, because Trues
(or Falses) is/are not Zero, nor is/are it/they a numeric value
