<h2> Exercise Sheets, Tutorials, and Assignments:</h2>
<p> Exercise Sheets will be posted on here, and will contain: Exercise Questions, to be discussed in the tutorials.
The main purpose of the tutorials is to discuss student work on these exercise
problems. Therefore, every student is expected to complete the scheduled work, i.e.,
exercise problems and necessary reading, before the corresponding tutorial session,
and bring their solutions and solution attempts to the Exercises Questions to the tutorial.
Use of the Exercise Questions for collaborative learning is encouraged.
The tutorials are not normally expected to be able to cover all the
  Exercise Questions.</p>

  <p> Assignment Questions will be grouped into five Assignments; each of these will
usually be due about two weeks after they are provided. Assignment Questions will
frequently be somewhat similar to some Exercise Questions.
Submit only your own solutions to Assignment Questions. If you have trouble
with any particular assignment question, identify related exercise questions and
possibly work with others on those to improve your understanding of the relevant
topics.
  </p>

  <p> It is essential that you meet the deadlines for the Assigment Questions; there is no
credit for documents handed in after the deadline.
If you cannot hand in your assignment on time due to (e.g.) illness
  reasons:
   </p><ul>
     <li>Hand your assignment in as soon as possible, before the next tutorial. If the
assignment in question required handing in paper, hand your solution either to the instructor,
or to a TA, or to Tina in the departmental office. (Outside office hours: Insert
into the drop box in front of the departmental office ITB-202.) We will make note of the
time of your submission. </li>
     <li>Follow the usual procedures for missed work with your Associate Dean’s office. The
outcome of that process will decide whether/how the late submission
can be counted. </li>
<li> A one-day illness will usually be accommodated via a one-day
extension.</li>
</ul>
  <p></p>

<div class="two">
<h3> Course Evaluation</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>5 Assignments - 40% </li>
    <li>Midterm - 15% - 30% </li>
    <li>Final - 30% - 45% </li>
    
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="city">
<h2>Grading: </h2>
<p>All examinations in this course will be Closed Book. That is, no written or printed material
nor electronic aids other than the standard McMaster calculator may be used during
  the examinations. </p>
  <h4> Accomodations for missed work:</h4>
  <p>Accomodations for missed work, including late assignments, require the corresponding
form from the Associate Dean’s office. Where you use the electronic system, note that
you are still required to get in touch with the instructor to actually be granted any
  accomodation. </p>

  <h4> Final Exam:</h4>
  <p> The final examination will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office in the
usual way. It will be a closed book examination of three hours duration and cover the
material of all lectures, tutorials, handouts, and assignments.</p>

  <h4> Midterms:</h4>
  <p> In addition, there will be one midterm examination, details to be announced.</p>

  <h4> Grade Calculation:</h4>
  <p>All exam grades will be percentage grades.
For every student, the course grade is calculated as a weighted
  average. The final course grade will be converted from a percentage grade to a letter grade
according to the scale of the Registrar’s Office.
  </p><ul>
    <li> 40% of the weight are given to the five assignments;</li>
    <li> if your midterm result is better than your result in the final, your midterm
counts 30%; otherwise your midterm counts 15%;</li>
    <li>the remaining weight (between 30% and 45%) is given to the final exam </li>
   
    </ul>

  <p></p>

  <h3> Course Adaptation:</h3>
  <p> The instructor and university reserve the right to modify elements of the course during
the term. The university may change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in
extreme circumstances. If either type of modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice
and communication with the students will be given with explanation and the opportunity
to comment on changes. It is the responsibility of the student to check their McMaster
email and course websites weekly during the term and to note any changes.</p>

</div>

<div class="city">
  <h3>Academic Ethics </h3>
  <p>You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning
process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic
integrity. </p>
  <p>Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in
unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences,
e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript
(notation reads: “Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty”), and/or suspension or
expulsion from the university. </p>
  <p>It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.
For information on the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the Academic
Integrity Policy, located at http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity. </p>
  <p>The following illustrates only four forms of academic dishonesty:
  </p><ol>
    <li> Plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other
credit has been obtained.</li>
    <li>Collaboration where individual work is expected. </li>
    <li>Improper collaboration in group work. </li>
    Copying or using unauthorised aids in tests and examinations. 

    </ol>

    <h3>Discrimination </h3>
    <p>The Faculty of Engineering is concerned with ensuring an environment that is free of all
adverse discrimination. If there is a problem that cannot be resolved by discussion among
the persons concerned, individuals are reminded that they should contact the Department
Chair, the Sexual Harassment Office or the Human Rights Consultant, as soon as possible. </p>
