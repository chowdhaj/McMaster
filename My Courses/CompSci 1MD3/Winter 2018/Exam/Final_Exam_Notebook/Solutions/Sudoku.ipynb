    "Here is the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Question 17: Sudoku [2 points, plus up to 3 bonus]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Sudoku is a puzzle game where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, each row, and each subgrid (that is, each group of 9 cells in the grid separated by the thicker lines) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. An example of a \"winning\" board is below:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Sudoku_Puzzle_by_L2G-20050714_solution_standardized_layout.svg\" width=35%>\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Write a program `sudoku(b)` that, given a sudoku board `b` represented as a 2 dimensional list (where each sublist represents a row in the board), determines if the board is filled out correctly. Return `True` if the board is correct, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> You can receive up to 3 bonus marks for a solution that is correct **and** short.  The shortest solution we came up with was 143 characters.  You will receive 1 bonus mark if your solution is correct and shorter than 600 characters, an additional 1 bonus mark if it is correct and shorter than 400 characters, and a third additional 1 bonus mark if it is correct and shorter than 200 characters.  There's a function at the end which shows how we measure the length of a solution."

It would be nice if we could compare `t` with our giant set on line 3, but `t` goes from 0 to 8, whereas our giant set on line 3 goes from 1 up to 9.  We'll change one of the three sets that are being differenced together (`ROW ^ COL ^ SUBSQ`) to go from 0-8 (`ROW(1-9) ^ COL(0-8) ^ SUBSQ(1-9)`).  If each set was exactly 1-9, then we get left with 0-8, which is exactly `t`."
