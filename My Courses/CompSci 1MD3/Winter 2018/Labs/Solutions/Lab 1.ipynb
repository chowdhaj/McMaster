    "#### Bonus: Dr. Cooperâ€™s Breakfast Egg (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Cooper is serious about his breakfast eggs. He is aware that as an egg cooks, the proteins first denature and then coagulate. When the temperature exceeds a critical point, reactions begin and proceed faster as the temperature increases. In the egg white the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above $63C$, while in the yolk the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above $70C$. For a soft-boiled egg, the egg white needs to have been heated long enough to coagulate at a temperature above $63$C, but the yolk should not be heated above $70C$. For a hard boiled egg, the center of the yolk should be allowed to reach $70C$. The following formula expresses the time t it takes (in seconds) for the center of the yolk to reach the temperature:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\large t = \\frac{M^{2/3}cÏ±^{1/3}}{K Ï€^2 (4Ï€ / 3)^{2/3}} \\ln{\\left[0.76\\frac{T_0 - T_w}{T_y - T_w}\\right]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $M$, $Ï±$, $c$, and $K$ are properties of the egg: $M$ is the mass, $Ï±$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $K$ is the thermal conductivity. Relevant values are $Ï± =1.038g~cm^{-3}$, $c = 3.7Jg^{-1}K^{-1}$, and $K = 5.4~10^{-3}W~cm^{-1}~K^{-1}$. Furthermore, $T_w$ is the temperature (in $C$ degrees) of the boiling water, $100C$, and $T_0$ is the original temperature (in $C$ degree) of the egg before being put in the water. For $T_y$ take $70C$. Write a Python function that helps Dr. Cooper to determine the correct cooking time. The function should take $M$ and $T_0$ as parameters. Run your implementation with $M=47g$ for a small egg and $M=67g$ for a larger egg and with $T_0=4C$ for an egg taken from the fridge and $T_0=20C$ for an egg with room temperature.\n"
