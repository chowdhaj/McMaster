Question 1

To develop any application program, one has to utilize some existing
application layer protocol. 

    [ ] True
    [X] False

Feedback: One can build applications using socket interfaces or even
          raw IP sockets

Question 2

Consider a path consisting of three nodes: A, B, C in a packet
switched network. The transmission speed of link (A,B) is s1 bps, and
the transmission speed of link (B,C) is s2 bps. The propagation delay
of each of these two links is d seconds. The packet size is p bits.
Node A sends two packets back-to-back at times t1 and t2,
respectively, to node B. That is, t2 = t1 + p/s1. 

i. Assume no initial queuing delay. The last bit of the first packet
   is received at node B at time _______.

    [ ] t2 + d + p/s1
    [ ] t1 + d + 2*p/s1 
    [ ] t1 + d
    [X] t1 + d + p/s1

Feedback: Transmission time = p/s1 and the propagation delay is d. 

Question 3

ii. The last bit of the second packet is received at node B at 
    time _______.

    [ ] t1 + d + p/s1
    [ ] t1 + d
    [ ] t2 + p/s1
    [X] t1 + d + 2*p/s1

Feedback: The 2nd packet is received at node B at:
          t2 + d + p/s1 = t1 + p/s1 + d + p/s1

Question 4

What is the condition that the 1st packet on node B has been delivered
to node C before the arrival of the 2nd packet ont node B? (In other 
words, the 2nd packet does not experience any queueing delay on node 
B) 

    [ ] s1 = s2
    [X] s1 <= s2
    [ ] s1 > s2

Feedback: From ii) we know that the 2nd packet arrives at:
          t1 + d + 2*p/s1. 
          So we want to have:
          t1 + d + 2*p/s1 >= t1 + d + p/s1 + p/s2 -> p/s1 >= p/s2 -> 
                                                       s1 <= s2. 
          In fact this result is intuitive. The effect that (B, C) has
          a higher rate than (A, B) can be thought as a thinner pipe
          feeds water to a fatter pipe; or one lane road feeds traffic
          to a two-lane road. There would not be any build-up. 

Question 5

Assume the speed of light is 3x108 in optical fiber. In the movie 
“The Martian”, Houston is to send a message of 50000 bytes to Mark on
Mars over a radio link at speed 5Kbps. Let Mars & Earth be at the 
orbital distance of 138 million km apart. Ignoring queuing and 
processing delay, it takes ______ seconds (integer) for the message
to reach Mark from Houston. 

    Answer: 540 Seconds

Feedback: 50000 * 8 / 5000 + 138 * 10^9 / 3x10^8 = 540s

Question 6 

Consider two ISPs A and B. Peering between them means data can be sent
back and forth between their respective customer networks without
charge. This arrangement is fair as the amount of data going from ISP
A to ISP B is always the same as the amount from ISP B to ISP A. 

    [ ] True
    [X] False

Feedback: This is not true. consider an example where ISP A hosts a
          lot of servers while ISP B hosts only clients. There is
          typically more data from ISP A to ISP B than from ISP B to
          ISP A. 

Question 7

Consider the following output from trace route:

Answer the following questions: 
The IP address of the first hop gateway router (in dot decimal
representation) is: ______. 
The average response time (between sending the probes and received the
response) to the 2nd hop router is ______ (ms) (use 3 digits after
decimal point, e.g, X.XXX). 
Judging from the domain name of the server in the last row of the
printout, Hamilton Spectator is most likely hosted by 
a) Google cloud, b) Microsoft Azure cloud, and c) Amazon web services 
(Enter a, b, c in the blank) ______.

    Answers: 130.113.68.5
             8.562
             C

Feedback: In the trace route example, the first column indicates the #
          of hops, the second column corresponds the IP or hostname of
          the respective router, the 3rd - 5th columns are the round
          trip time to the respective routers measured in ms.
