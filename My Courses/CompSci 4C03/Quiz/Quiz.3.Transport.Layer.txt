Question 1

UDP and TCP use 16-bit 1's complement of 1's complement sum in
computing Internet checksums. Consider the following data:
4510 003c 1c46 4501 4006 b1e6 ac10 0a63
The checksum is given by 0x______.

    Answer: B10B

Feedback: 0x4510 + 0x003c + 0x1c46 + 4501 + 0x4006 + 0xb1e6 + 0xac10 +
          0x0a63 = 0x24EF2

          Add the carrier: 0x24EF2 + 0x2 = 0x4EF4
          The 1's complement of 0x49e3 is B10B
          B10B = 0xFFFF - 0x49e3

Question 2

Imagine that we develop a congestion control mechanism based on
Multiplicative Increase and Multiplicative Decrease, namely, if
congestion occurs, all senders will cut back sending rate by half or
otherwise double the sending rate every RTT. Which of the following
properties is/are true for this mechanism? Check all that apply. 

    [ ] Fair
    [ ] Efficient
    [ ] Converging to equilibrium quickly
    [X] None above

Feedback: This mechanism would lead to oscillation for sending rate.
          For instance, with bottleneck BW 8, the senders start from
          2, 4 respectively. Their sending rates would be 

          1RTT 4, 8
          2RTT 2, 4
          3RTT 4, 8
          ...

          Therefore, this scheme is not efficient, fair or
          converging.

Question 3

Consider transferring an enormous file of L bytes from Host A to Host
B. Assume MSS = 255 bytes. The minimum value of L equals ______ (in 
decimal numbers) when the sequence number in TCP header for this
connection is repeated again.
HINT: An SYN segment with InitialSeqNumber counts as one byte. So the
next data segment after SYNC starts from InitialSeqNumber + 1.

    Answer: 4294967295

Question 4

In absence of options, the size of TCP header is of length ______
bytes. 

    Answer: 20

Feedback: (32 x 5) / 8 = 20

Question 5

Let the sequence number field of a 450-byte segment be 2000. Then, the
acknowledge number of TCP ACK to this segment is ______. The sequence
number of the next segment from the sender is______.

    Answer: 2450
            2450

Feedback: TCP ACKS the next byte expected. 

Question 6

Consider a TCP Reno connection with CWND = 5MSS. It is not limited by
the receiver window size. Consider the first two segments are lost but
subsequent segments and all ACK segments are reliably delivered. Will
fast retransmit and fast recovery be triggered in this case?


    [X] Yes
    [ ] No

Feedback: 3 duplicated ACKs will be received. Therefore, fast re-
          transmit and fast recovery will be triggered.

Question 7

SampleRTT = 11ms, EstimateRTT = 9ms, DevRTT = 1ms, alpha = 0.125, 
beta = 0.25. 

The next EstimateRTT is ______ ms. The next DevRTT is ______ ms (Do
not round. Give exact values). The TimeoutInterval is ______ ms. (Do 
not round. Give exact values).

    Answer: 9.25
            1.1875
            14

Feedback: EstimatedRTT = 9*0.875 + 11*0.125 = 9.25ms
          DevRTT = 0.75*1 + 0.25*(11 - 9.25) = 1.1875ms

          TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT
                          = 9.25 + (4 * 1.1874)
                          = 9.25 + 4.75
                          = 14ms

Question 8

We define a round as one RTT time. Consider a TCP Reno sender with
initial CWND = 1MSS and assume the RWND is infinite. Suppose the
initial ss_thresh = 16MSS. Assume no packet losses. At the end of
round 1 or the beginning of round 2, CWND = 2MSS. The sender enters
congestion avoidance phase at the beginning of round ______. Assume no
packet losses, the CWND at the end of round 6 is ______ MSS. Assume
two packets are lost at the beginning of round 6. Immediately after
the detection of packet losses, CWND equals ______ MSS and
ss_threshold equals ______ MSS.

    Answer: 5
            18
            8.5
            8.5

Feedback: |---------------|----------|-------------|
          | Round/CWND At | No Loss  | 2-Loss      |
          | Beginning Of  |          | (Round 6)   |
          | Round (MSS)   |          |             |

          | 3             | 4        | 4           |
          | 4             | 8        | 8           |

          | 6             | 17       | 17          |

          |---------------|----------|-------------|

Question 9

The 3rd step is needed in the 3-way handshake in TCP connection
establishment because (select all that apply)

    [X] A TCP client (active open) needs to confirm the initial
        sequential number used by the TCP server (passive open)
    [ ] It is needed in case that the first SYN from the TCP client
        (active open) is lost
    [X] It is needed to acknowledge the passive open of the connection
        by the server.  
    [ ] Two-way handshake is sufficient.
