                         /          |         \

Note: `X` = A Computer

According to the figure above, the number of contention domain(s) is
______, and the number of broadcast domain(s) is ______.

    Answer: 3
            1

Question 4

In WLANs, a single AP device may host multiple BSS with different
SSIDs.

    [X] True
    [ ] False

Feedback: A single AP device can host multiple virtual LANs with
          different SSIDs. one such example is MacWiFi and eduroam on
          campus. 

Question 5

Consider a 802.11 frame originated from a wireless host with address
1, 2, 3 fields being A, B, C. Put A, B or C in the following blanks.
The frame is originated from ______. The access point is ______. The
MAC address of the router interface to which the AP is attached to is
______.

    Answer: B
            A
            C

Feedback: Address 1 is the MAC address of wireless host or AP to
          receive this frame.
          Address 2 is the MAC address of wireless host or AP
          transmitting this frame
          Address 3 is the MAC address of router interface to which AP
          is attached.

Question 6

Consider the example given in the lecture on the self-learning
algorithm in Ethernet LAN (shown in the figure below). Suppose
initially the switch table is empty. Which of the following link layer
frames allow the switch to learn that host A is connected to interface
1? Check all that apply. 

    [ ] A frame from D to A. 
    [X] A frame from A to B.
    [X] A frame from A to D. 
    [ ] A message from B to A. 

Feedback: Switches can learn the interface a host is attached to via
          messages originated from the host. 

Question 7

Distributed Coordination Function Inter-frame Spacing (DIFS) may be
utilized before the transmission of which of the following frame types
(check all that apply) in 802.11? 

    [X] Data frames
    [ ] ACK
    [X] Association request frames
    [ ] Poll response frames

Feedback: If RTS/CTS is enabled, SIFS is used before RTS transmissions
          as well. 

Question 8

Consider three WiFi devices A, B, C in a 802.11 WLAN. Both A and B
have frames to send to C and can hear C's transmissions. Which of the
following scenarios will result in collisions? Check all that apply.
(Hint: DIFS = 2xslot_time + SIFS). 

    [ ] A and B are hidden terminals to each other. At time t0, A just
        successfully sent a frame to C and is waiting for an
        acknowledge frame from C (A has no more frame to send); B has
        a backoff timer of 1 and a frame to send to C. 
    [ ] A and B can hear each other's transmissions. Both A and B have
        frames to send to C. At time t0, A starts a backoff timer of 2
        slots. B just arrives to the network.
    [ ] A and B can hear each other's transmissions. At time t0, A
        just successfully sent a frame to C and is waiting for an
        acknowledge frame from C (A has no more frame to send); B has
        a backoff timer of 1 and a frame to send to C. 
    [X] A and B are hidden terminals to each other. At time t0, A
        starts a backoff timer of 2 slots. B just arrives to the network. 

Feedback: 1) B will wait for DIFS before its transmission. Since it
             cannot hear A's transmissions, collisions will occur. 
          2) B will sense the medium busy upon hearing A's
             transmission. 
          3) 4) acknowledgement from C defers by SIFS and does not
                collide with B's transmissions.
