Consider the firewall access control list discussed in the lecture.
Answer the following questions

1. The firewall is a (stateful or stateless) ______ firewall. 

2. Can you host a web server listening to port 80 on a host in the
   subnet 222.22/16 behind the firewall to serve requests from
   computers outside the subnet? (yes or no) ______. 

3. Can you successfully ssh to a remote server from a host on the
   subnet 222.22/16? (yes or no) ______. 

    Answer: stateful
            no
            no
         
Feedback: The firewall rules track the status of a connection. The
          firewall only allows DNS requests/responses and access to
          remote web servers. The last rule applies for all other
          traffic.
