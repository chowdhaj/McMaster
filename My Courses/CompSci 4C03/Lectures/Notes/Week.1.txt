    - Introduction
        - This course is about the history of the internet, and its 
          logistics
        - For this week, the required reading is chapter 1 of the 
          textbook
            - Textbook: Computer Networking By Kurose & Ross
    - Computer Networks
        - A computer network is a system for communicating among two 
          or more computers
            - This system includes both hardware and software
                - The softare is crucial because it implements the 
                  protocols and services
                    - i.e. Software that runs on network routers
            - Computers are not limited to end-user devices, but 
              includes machines responsible for facilitating
              interchange of information and communication
                - i.e. Routers, Gateways, etc.
            - Communication in the network is about the bits being 
              transferred from one node to another
                - Note: A node is a machine in a network
        - There are many forms of networks
            - i.e.
                - Local Area Network (LAN)
                - Home Network
                - Dedicated Network
                    - i.e. Missile Control
                - Wide Area Network (WAN)
    - Trivia Questions
        - In 1971, a computer engineer named Ray Tomlinson sent the 
          first [Email]
            - Inside that email, he said [QWERTYUIOP]
        - In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist, invented 
          [HTML]
            - He got a Turing Award for this
        - In 1994, [Al Gore] said, "I took the initiative in creating 
          the Internet"
            - Fact: Al Gore helped in funding the internet's creation
        - Instagram was launched in [2010]
        - [Twitter] blocked President Trump's account in Jan. 2021
    - History Of The Internet
        - 1961-1970
            - DARPA started the development of packet switching 
              technology
        - 1972-1980
            - The rise of proprietary networks and internetworking
                - i.e. ALOHA, Ethernet, Defense Networks, Etc.
            - Development of TCP, UDP, IP, etc. started ramping up
        - 1980-1990
            - Networks started to proliferate
                - This led to the standardization of networking 
                  protocols
                    - i.e. TCP/IP, DNS, Etc.
                - i.e. The NSF builds the NSFNET as backbone and 
                       connects 10,000 computers
        - 1990s
            - Internet exploded as people realized the potential of 
              the internet
                - i.e. Emails, sharing files, instant messaging, etc.
            - The emergence of the World Wide Web (WWW)
                - Invented by Tim Berners-Lee
        - 2000s
            - More than 1 billion hosts including smartphones and 
              tablets
            - 2001 :: BitTorrent
                - Peer-to-peer file sharing protocol

            - 2020 :: 5G cellular data networks are on the rise
            - Currently, there are so many devices connected that IPV4 
              addresses have run out, and we have now resorted to IPV6 
              addreses

    - Outline
        - Topic
            - Internet: Nuts and bolts
        - Readng
            - K & R : Chapter 1
    - What Is The Internet
        - Highly distributed network of machines that share
          information
            - There is no single point of failure or central server
        - Hosts on the internet are not directly connected to other
          hosts
            - i.e. There isn't a direct cable from your home network
                   to Google's servers
        - The internet is a network of networks
            - Switches and routers help us connect to end hosts
                - Each router you connect to is considered a hop
                - If a single router fails, then the traffic is
                  rerouted
        - There are over a billion connected computing devices
            - Hosts are the end systems
            - Each device is running network applications to
              communicate
        - Communication is done through:
            - Fiber, copper cable, radio, satellite, etc.
                - The transmission rate is measured in bandwidth
                    - Fiber optical cables have a very high
                      transmission rate
        - Inside each network, there are packet switches that forward
          packets
            - i.e. Routers and switches
            - Packets are chunks of data
    - Examples Of Network Components
        - Links
            - Fiber optical links
                - Very fast and can support gigabit networks
            - Coaxial cable
                - Copper cables are slowly being phased out in favor
                  of Fiber
        - Interfaces
            - Ethernet card
                - Used for wired connection, typically on a desktop
            - Wireless card
                - i.e. WiFi dongle
        - Switches/Routers
            - Large router
            - Switch
                - Switches and routers comprise the internal network
                  of the internet
                - Your home router connects your devices to outside
                  networks
    - Internet Structure: Network Of Networks
        - Internet Service Provider (ISP)
            - Provide internet access to end-systems
                - i.e. Your phone, laptop, etc.
            - ISPs have different tiers
                - i.e.
                    - Tier 1
                    - Tier 2
                    - Tier 3
                    - Local ISP
            - ISPs connect to each other to form the backbone of the
              internet
                - The internet is a network of networks
        - Connection type:
            - Customers and providers
                - Customer pays provider for access to the Internet
            - Peering relationship
                - Peers provide transit between their respective
                  customers
                - Peers do not provide transit between peers
    - Customers and Providers
        - Customer pays provider access to the internet
            - i.e. You paying Rogers a monthly fee to connect to their
                   network
            - i.e. Rogers pays a top tier ISP to connect to their
                   network
        - This relationship allows your data to travel to the provider
          network
    - The Peering Relationship
        - Peering relationships typically happen between ISPs of the 
          same tier
            - Peers provide transit between their respective customers
                - However, peers do not provide transmit between 
                  peers, because it does not help the middle peer to 
                  process data that is not its own
        - Low tier ISPs only have regional connectivity, but they can
          connect to higher tier ISPs to connect to the global network
        - Peering relationships allow customers on different ISPs to 
          connect/talk to each other
            - i.e. A peering connection between Canadian ISPs and 
                   American ISPs, allows Canadians to send data to 
                   Americans. The data travels like this:
                   Canadian customer -> Canadian ISP -> 
                   American ISP -> American Customer
        - Peering relationships help to avoid additional charge(s)
        - In order to connect local ISPs, a top tier ISP is used to 
          connect them
            - Top tier ISPs and local ISPs have a provider-customer 
              relationship
                - Local ISPs pay money to top tier ISPs, to connect to
                  their networks and other networks, indirectly
        - Can be done through a direct link or a Network Access Point;
          abbreviated as NAP
    - Internet Structure: Network Of Networks
        - Internet providers are not flat, they are organized in a
          hierarchical manner
        - At the center, there are Tier 1 ISPs
            - i.e. Sprint, AT&T, Cogent Communication, etc.
                - They provide national/multi-national coverage
                - These ISPs interconnect privately
                    - i.e. They have a peering relationship
        - Tier 2 ISPs are smaller, often regional, ISPs
            - Tier 2 ISPs connect to one or more tier-1 ISPs, through
              a customer-provider relationship
                - Each tier 1 ISP has many tier 2 customers
            - Tier 2 ISPs can peer directly with each other
                - This bypasses the tier 1 ISPs
        - Tier 3 ISPs and Local ISPs
            - These are customers of higher tier ISPs
                i.e. Customer-provider relationship with tier 2 and
                     tier 1 ISPs
            - Very rarely do they have peer relationships among
              themselves
        - A message passes through many networks from source host to
          destination host
            - i.e. Your computer -> local ISP -> Tier 3 ISP -> 
                   Tier 2 ISP -> Tier 1 ISP -> Tier 1 ISP -> 
                   Tier 2 ISP -> local ISP -> Your friend
    - Traceroute
        - Is a tool to look inside the "blackbox" of the Internet
            - It provides delay measurements from source to router 
              along end-to-end Internet path towards destination
        - Traceroute sends 3 packets from your machine to each network
          node
            - It records the interval time between transmission and
              reply
        - Traceroute sets a max number of hops
            - i.e. If traceroute sets 64 as max hops, and there are
                   more than 64 nodes to connect to, then the program 
                   will fail. However, this is unlikely in the realm 
                   of the internet
            - The routing protocol sets limitations on a max number of
              hops
        - The first IP in traceroute is your private IP on your home
          network
        - The three numbers after the IP is the latency measured from
          your machine to the first hub/router

    - Traceroute
        - Is a tool used to look inside the "blackbox" of the Internet
          through an end-system, such as a laptop or desktop
            - It works by sending multiple probes/packets to each hop
              along the path from your computer to a destination host
                - The round trip time from your computer to each hop
                  is measured
                    - This gives the latency of reaching each router
                      along the path
                    - Traceroute returns 3 latency measurements for
                      each hop
                        - It is possible for the latency for a far
                          away node to be less than the latency for a
                          closer node, due to traffic variation and
                          other factors
            - Traceroute is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux
                - On macOS and Linux it is in-built
        - Examples of traceroute
            - i.e. traceroute www.uh.edu
            - i.e. traceroute www.google.com
        - Packet Loss
            - If there is an asterisk instead of the latency time,
              then the packet took too long to get back or it never
              returned
                - In other words, the probe/packet was not recieved in
                  a timely manner
    - Packet Switching: Store & Forward
        - Packet switching technology was invented in 1960-1970s
            - It is now the foundation of the internet
        - Packets are small units of information
            - Each packet/unit is delievered individually, hop-by-hop,
              from source to destination
                - The entire packet must arrive at a router/hop before
                  it can be transmitted to the next link/hop
                    - This is called "store and forward"
                        - The packet must be stored before it can be
                          forwarded
                - An individual packet can be forwarded along
                  different network paths
            - The size of the packet depends on the Operating system
                - Typically, the size of an ethernet packet is 1000
                  bytes
    - Before packet switching was invented, telephones used circuit
      switching
        - You had to manually create the circuit between source and
          destination
            - Setting up this connection is time consuming
    - Loss & Delay (1)
        - There are 4 types of packet delays and one type of packet
          loss
            - Packet Loss
                - If there are no free buffers, the arriving packets
                  are dropped
                    - By definition, this isn't really a delay, but it
                      can affect the time it takes for packets to 
                      reach the destination, because packets need to
                      be re-sent
            - Queueing Delay
                - If there are packets in the buffer, then the
                  arriving packets are placed into the buffer, and
                  they must wait for their turn
            - Processing Delay
                - The packet is checked for integrity, and the router 
                  ensures that it is not corrupted
                - The router determines where the packet needs to be
                  sent to by performing a lookup in a router table
            - Transmission Delay
                - When the packet is ready to be transmitted, it will
                  take some time to transmit from the first bit of the
                  packet to the last bit of the (same) packet
            - Propagation Delay
                - Once the packet is transmitted, it needs to travel
                  along the "wire" to reach the destination; and there
                  is some delay to this
                    - Propagation delay is determined by the distance
                      between the source, and the (physical) maximum
                      speed it can travel at
        - Packet switching can cause packet loss and packet delay
            - Consider the following scenario:
                1. Packets arrive at an intermediate router, they are
                   first stored in the router's buffer
                    - Note: If the buffer is full, then the packets
                            are dropped
                2. Once the entire packet arrives, the integrity of
                   the packet is checked to make sure it is not
                   corrupted
                    - This is processing delay
                3. Then, the router decides where the packet needs to
                   be forwarded to
                    - i.e. Lookup, in a huge table, which network/
                           router it needs to be sent to. This is
                           processing delay.
                4. Since this entire process is time consuming, the
                   packets are put in a queue, and they wait their
                   turn for processing
                    - If packets arrive faster than they are sent,
                      then they have to wait for their turn, causing
                      you to experience higher latency
                        - This is queueing delay
                5. Once packet is ready to be transmitted, it takes
                   time for the packet to be sent from the first bit
                   to the last bit
                    - This is transmission delay
                6. The transmitted packet must now travel, wired or
                   wirelessly, from the source to the destination
                    - This is propagation delay
            - Packet delay can be observed in traceroute
                - i.e. The 3 latency numbers
    - Loss & Delay (2)
        - The ports on a switch are called interfaces
            - A switch will typically have multiple interfaces
                - Interfaces connect switches with other switches
            - Every interface on a switch has its own queue
                - Processing delay occurs in the incoming interface
                  and outgoing interface 
                    - Most of the processing delay occurs in the
                      outgoing interface
                        - This is because the packet can arrive faster
                          than it can be delievered
                    - Processing in incoming interface is fast because
                      the computation is done in hardware
            - The switch looks at the destination IP address in the
              packet, and uses it to determine which switch it needs
              to send the packet to
                - It does this by looking up information in a routing
                  table
                    - This is computed ahead of time
                    - This causes processing delay
            - Once the lookup is done, the packet is sent to the
              outgoing interface through the switch fabric
        - Routers do not make any attempt to recover dropped/loss
          packets
            - The application is responsible for ensuring that all
              packets have been sent/recieved    
    - Four Sources Of Packet Delay
        1. Processing Delay (Computational)
            - Check bit errors 
            - Determine output link
            - Deep packet inspection
                - Very expensive, computationally
                - Used for detecting virus signature in a packet
            - Measured in micro-seconds
        2. Queueing Delay
            - Time waiting at output link/interface for transmission
            - Depends on congestion level of router
                - i.e. Rush hour VS. Non-rush hour
            - Has the biggest variability
            - Measured in milli-seconds
            - Queueing delay occurs when the incoming traffic is
              faster than the rate of the outgoing link/interface
                - This can be measured with the following formula: 
                  TI = (L * (a / R))
                    - Where:
                        - TI = Traffic Intensity
                        - R  = Link bandwidth (bps)
                        - L  = Packet length (bits)
                        - a  = Average packet arrival rate (packet/s)
                    - And If:
                        - (L * (a / R)) ~  0 
                            - If it is close to 0, then the average
                              queueing delay becomes small
                        - (L * (a / R)) -> 1
                            - If it approaches 1, then the delays
                              becomes large
                        - (L * (a / R)) >  1
                            - If it is greater than 1, then more
                              "work" is arriving than what the switch
                              can process, causing the average delay
                              to be infinite
                                - This is true if the buffer is
                                  infinitely large
        3. Transmission Delay (Outgoing)
            - This is dictated by the link bandwidth
                - The time to send bits into the link is: (L / R)
                    - Where,
                        - R = Link bandwidth (bps)
                        - L = Packet length (bits)
        4. Propagation Delay
            - This depends on time, because the delay is determined by
              the physical distance between two spaces
            - Propagation delay can be determined by: (d / s)
                - Where,
                    - d = The length of the physical link
                    - s = Propagation speed in medium
                        - Typically, propagation speed is the speed of
                          light (c)
                            - c = (3 x 10^8) m/s
    - Nodal Delay
        - Combining the four sources of delay yields the nodal delay
        - Every single hop that the packet traverses will incur those
          four kinds of delay
            - This is modeled by: (d_nodal = d_proc  + d_queue +
                                             d_trans + d_prop ) 
                - Where:
                    - d_proc = Processing delay
                        - Caused by error checking OR determining
                          which outgoing interface the packet needs to
                          be delivered to
                        - Typically a few micro-seconds or less
                    - d_queue = Queueing delay
                        - Depends on the level of the network load
                            - i.e. How many packets are buffered in
                                   the router's incoming and outgoing
                                   interface. 
                        - If incoming traffic is greater than outgoing
                          traffic, then the network will slow down,
                          and latency will increase
                    - d_trans = Transmission delay
                        - Depends on the equation: (L / R)
                        - This is significant for low-speed links
                    - d_prop = Propagation delay
                        - Depends on the physical distance between the
                          hops
                            - i.e. Greater distance equals more time
                                   to send packets
                        - A few micro-seconds to hundreds of milli-
                          seconds
    - Example
        - Question
            - In the movie, "The Martian", Houston sends a message of
              50000 bytes to Mark on Mars over a radio link at speed 1
              Kbps. Mars and Earth are at the orbital closest distance
              of 56 million km apart. How long does it take for the 
              message to reach Mark from Houston?
              (Hint #1: Ignore the processing and queueing delay)
              (Hint #2: Speed of light = 3 x 10^8 m/s)
        - Answer
            - 1 Kbps = 1 Kilo-bit-per-second
                - Note: Uppercase 'B' is byte && lowercase 'b' is bit
            - You only need to consider transmission delay and
              propagation delay
                - Transmission delay:
                    - TD = L/R 
                         = 50000 x 8 / 1000
                         = 400 seconds
                    - The 50000 bytes is converted into bits by
                      multiplying it by 8
                    - L = Length of message
                    - R = Rate (speed)
                - Propagation delay:
                    - PD = d/c
                         = (56 x 10^9) / (3 x 10^8)
                         = 186 seconds
                    - The distance is converted into meters
                    - d = Distance between source and destination
                    - c = Speed of light
                - Total Delay = Transmission Delay + Propagation Delay
                              = 400 + 186
                              = 586 seconds
    - Numerical Example
        - Question
            - Houston to send a message of 50000 bytes to Mark on Mars
              over a radio link at a speed of 1 Kbps. Mars and Earth
              are at the orbital furthest distance of 140 million km
              apart. From the previous question, what has changed?
              How long does it take for the message to reach Mark from
              Houston?
              (Hint #1: Ignore the processing and queueing delay)
              (Hint #2: Speed of light = 3 x 10^8 m/s)
        - Answer
            - The only thing that has changed is the propagation delay
                - Propagation delay:
                    - PD = d/c
                         = (140 x 10^9) / (3 x 10^8)
                         = 466.666666666
                         ~ 466.67
                - Transmission delay:
                    - 400 seconds
                        - See above
                - Total Delay = Transmission Delay + Propagation Delay
                              = 400 + 466.67
                              = 866.67 seconds
    - Packet Losses
        - In addition to packet delay, packet can also get lost when
          they are transitioning through the network
        - There are a number of reasons why packets can get lost
            - Transmission links can be unreliable
                - Radio links are notorious for their unreliability
                    - Bit error rate of ~10^-6 in radios
                        - In a transfer of 1 million bits, 1 bit will
                          be corrupted
                    - Bits can be corrupted due to noise at source or
                      host
                - Optical links have a very high reliability rate,
                  because optical cables are highly insulated 
                    - Bit error rate of ~10^-15
            - Network congestion can cause packet loss
                - Lots of traffic fills up the queue/buffer, causing
                  new packets to be dropped when they arrive to the
                  switch
        - When packets are corrupted or lost, the routers can detect
          it
            - The routers cannot recieve the message at all, or they
              detect some error in the message
                - Typically, the router discards the packet, and does
                  not try to repair it
    - Review Of Lecture/Week 1
        - Internet is a network of networks consisting of different
          ISPs at different tiers
            - ISPs can have two relationships:
                1. Customer-Provider
                2. Peering
            - Since the internet is a network of network, it is quite
              resilient, and does not have one point of failure
                - i.e. Local outage won't affect other areas
            - It is possible to have multiple ISPs as your provider
                - This is "multi-homing"
        - Traceroute allows end hosts to "probe" the paths that
          packets follow to a specified destination
            - With traceroute, you can also see the approximate
              roundtrip delay for a particular hub, the IP address or
              domain name, etc.
        - Packets are delivered hop-by-hop through the internet by 
          routers and switches
            - There can be losses and delays at the routers/switches
                - Packet losses are caused by network congestion
                - Delays are caused by the store-and-forward networks
