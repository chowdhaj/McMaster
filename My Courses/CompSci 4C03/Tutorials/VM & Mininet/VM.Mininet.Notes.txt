- Introduction
    - VM = Virtual Machine
    - Mininet = Software

- Security Lab Scenario
    - Why do we need Mininet?
        - Assume a security lab scenario where there is a client and victim 
          server serving on ports corresponding to telnet, SSH, HTTP, etc.
            - However, there is no encryption, and an attacker is sniffing and
              conducting a "man in the middle" attack using Netwox
                - Netwox is another software application that allows attackers
                  to see communication taking place between client and server

- Lab Environment
    - A network of three nodes: Leg, Att, Vic
        - i.e.
              Att                  Leg                 Vic
            10.0.0.1            10.0.0.2            10.0.0.3
                |                   |                   |
                |-------------------|-------------------|
                |                                       |
                |         Controller As a HUB           |
                |                                       |
                |---------------------------------------|
            - This is a network framework
            - The nodes are:
                - Leg = Legitimate
                - Att = Attacker
                - Vic = Victim
            - Each node has its own IP address, and they are connected to the HUB
    - Since setting up 3 standalone machines and a hub for each node is exhausting
      and expensive, Mininet is used to emulate the entire network

- Mininet
    - Mininet allows us to test our code before deploying it to the real world
        - Mininet can emulate real networks
    - Mininet creates a realistic virtual network, running real kernel, switch,
      and application code on a single machine
        - You do not need to buy a lot of devices to test your code on a network
            - Buying individual devices costs a lot of money
    - You can define your network architecture in Python using the Mininet package
        - You will have to program it yourself
    - Mininet is based on SDN
        - SDN = Software Design Network
    - The SDN controller in Mininet can configure the network switch in such a
      way that it acts as a hub

- Software Defined Network (SDN)
    - SDN entails the decoupling of the control plane from the forwarding plane
      and offloads its functions to a centralized controller
    - SDN enabled nodes do not need to run control protocols among themselves
      and instead rely upon the central controller
    - "Controller defined" or "Centralized control" may be more appropriate
    - A traditional network consists of forwarding devices with embedded control,
      and middleboxes (i.e. Firewall)
        - The control is distributed
    - In a software software defined network, a software controller handles
      forwarding devices with decoupled control

- Demo
    - Install Oracle VM Virtualbox
    - Download the OS image, and use it to create a VM
        - Refer to the PDF on Avenue
        - The OS image is preconfigured, and the networks have already been setup
    - The Mininet executable opens 5 windows:
        - Mininet console
            - The console controls everything
        - Wireshark
        - 3 users: victim, attacker, legitimate user
    - The command `netstate -a` checks the state of the network
        - i.e. What services are running
    - The `netwox` command runs the software Netwox
    - The `ifconfig` command tests the network
        - Returns the IP address
