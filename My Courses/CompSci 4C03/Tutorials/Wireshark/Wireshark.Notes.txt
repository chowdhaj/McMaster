- What Is Wireshark?
    - Wireshark is a network packet/protocol analyzer
        - A network packet analyzer will try to capture network packets and displays 
          the packet's data in a detailed manner
    - Wireshark is the best open source packet analyzer available for Unix and
      Windows

- Purposes
    - Network administrators use Wireshark to troubleshoot network problems
    - Network security engineers use Wireshark to examine security problems
    - Developers use Wireshark to debug protocol implementations
    - Students use Wireshark to learn the internals of network protocols
        - i.e. Protocols like HTTP, TCP, UDP, Etc.
    - Note: Wireshark is not an instrusion detection system
        - Wireshark does not manipulate packets on the network
            - Instead, it will passively capture them

- How It Works
    - Wireshark monitors the activity of the network card at the operating system
      level
        - It will have a copy of each packet transmitted by the network card
            - This requires root privilegies on macOS and Linux

- User Interfaces
    - With Wireshark, you can monitor multiple interfaces or different types of network
      connections
        - i.e. Wireless, Wired, Etc.
    - At the top is the toolbar
        - You can start monitoring or start capturing
    - Below the toolbar is a list of packets
    - The middle window contains headers and structural information for the selected
      packets 
    - The bottom window contains binary or hex numbers with specific information

- Live Demo
    - Active interfaces will have network activity, causing fluctuations
    - The Loopback interface is used for testing TCP/IP programming tasks
        - It is a virtual interface designed for testing purposes of local addresses
            - The Loopback interface does not connect to the global internet
    - The search filter helps you isolate communication with specific servers
        - i.e. ip.src == 130.113.68.10 || ip.dst = 130.113.68.10
               src is the source IP address
               dst is the destination IP address
    - The binary stream window might contain some english text, but for the most part
      it is unreadable by humans
    - ACK is an acknowledgement packet

- Some Tips
    - Select the correct network interface
        - Usually the network with the most activity is the one you want to inspect
    - If Wireshark isn't capturing anything, try a different browser, clear cache, or
      load up the browser in private mode
        - Refreshing the page may not always work
    - Carefully use the filter to select important packets
        - Do not type 'HTTP' to observe the HTTP protocol
            - It is better to specify the target and source destination
                - i.e. ip.src == 130.113.68.10 || ip.dst = 130.113.68.10
