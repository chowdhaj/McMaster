Lab 1 Report

Q1 - Jiffies

Module Description

The Jiffies kernel module creates a file, 'jiffies' in the proc/ directory when it is loaded. Then, when the file is read, the current value of 'jiffies' is retrieved and printed to the file. This occurs whenever the 'jiffies' file is read (i.e. cat /proc/jiffies). The Jiffies value is retrieved from the 'jiffies.h' header file, which is a library containing the value. For more information, please reference the source code files attached, namely 'proc_jiffy.c'.

Most of the code was licensed from "Operating System Concepts - 10th Edition", under the GPL license, which allows end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. 

Source Code: proc_jiffy.c*, (Makefile*)

Q2 - Seconds

Module Description

The Seconds kernel module creates a file, 'seconds' in the proc/ directory when it is loaded. In addition, the moment the Seconds kernel module is loaded, the current value of Jiffies is retrieved from 'jiffies.h' and stored. Then, when the file 'seconds' is read, (i.e. cat /proc/seconds), the following information is printed to the 'seconds' file:
    - Initial Jiffies
    - Current Jiffies
    - HZ
    - Time Elapsed
The 'Time Elapsed' value is the most important value here. It represents the time elapsed since the module was initially loaded and the moment the 'seconds' file was read. The value outputted is measured in seconds. For more information, please reference the source code files attached, namely 'proc_seconds.c'.

Most of the code was licensed from "Operating System Concepts - 10th Edition", under the GPL license, which allows end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software.
